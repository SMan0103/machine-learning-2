<h1>Machine learning</h1>

<div> 
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is a Github repo that is made by Anders and Emil</p>
    <p>The reason for starting this repo is to learn how to build a machine learning algorithm that is almost made by us</p>
    <p>We are going to write this program in the language c++</p>
</div>

<div> 
    <h2> Discussion </h2>
    <p> 
        The reason for choosing the language c++ is after talking about what language that wil make this a okay Alogritem
        and after talking to a TA about how we need to learn c++ in later semesters, so we through that this will come in handy to learn now.

    <h2>Roadmap</h2>
    <li>Learn syntax and fundamentals of c++</li>
    <li>Learn the basics of making a machine learning algorithms</li>
    <li>Apply what we found out in step two</li>

<div>
    <h2>Tools</h2>
    <h3>Math tools</h3>
    <P>Vi will be using xtensor for the  math operators in other code base</P>
